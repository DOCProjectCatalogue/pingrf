Pingrf implements RF communications with the Animas OneTouch Ping
insulin pump. Pingrf is factored into three components: Packet radio
firmware (using the TI/Chipcon CC11xx series chips); a radio RPC
layer, so that clients may communicate with the packet radio through
UART or SPI; and a pump driver, which implements the pump session
and application layers.

All are provided as cleanly separated APIs.

Command cmd/pingrf implements a utility and test client for pingrf
using Unix ttys. This tool demonstrates how to construct a pump client
and invoke it. It's also useful in its own right, e.g.,:

	% pingrf -h
	usage: pingrf [-t tty] [-b baud] [-dh] command [options]
	Where command is one of:
	  chkadd data checksum
		Add known data-checksum pair. Arguments are hexdecimal strings.
	  combo insulin hours
		Issue a combo bolus for the given amount of insulin and time.
	  cancelcombo
		Cancel a currently running combo bolus.
	  pcall status
		Retrieve the home-screen status message of the pump
	  pcall status1
		Retreive status screen 1 from the pump
	  pcall status2
		Retriece status screen 2 from the pump
	  pcall status3
		Retrieve status screen 3 from the pump
	  pcall cancelcombo
		Cancel an existing combo bolus
